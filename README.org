This repository contains the code used for our analysis in [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijar.2023.108930][Conceptual
Views on Tree Ensemble Classifiers]]. Detailed descriptions on the
experiments and the used data can be found in the article. To run the
experiments place the data set in the data directory, run the
~init.sh~ skript, install the python dependencies and start the
scripts you want from the src directory or the tree2ctx clojure
project.
